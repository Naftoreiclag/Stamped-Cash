Stamped Cash
============
*This repository contains a very old (>2 years old) idea I had for a [Bukkit](http://bukkit.org) plugin that added a form of liquid asset "money" to [Minecraft](https://minecraft.net). Basically, instead of the traditional money-represented-as-a-double system that most Minecraft rpg servers had, I wanted money represented by "physical" in-game items that could be stored in traditional storage containers, such as chests, storage minecarts, furnaces, etc... to make the money feel more "real" and "rpg-ish."* -Me, 2015
